Our project consists of a Web-based application for an After-school Management System. This Webpage will give access to all the parents whose children are part of the After-school program.  Some features that we can mention are: leaving appointments with the teachers, being able to see the progress the kids are making daily, being able to see all the homework that the kids might not have done/have to do for the next day at school or afterschool, fun puzzles/crosswords, leaving messages for the teachers for everything that isn’t clear, being shown the timetable for every course like art class, english/french class etc.   The implementation of the idea will work closely with the parents by having access at their actual webpage application. After-school teachers will be the ones to reply to the messages from the parents.


Product Requirements.
*   The system will be easy to use so the user won't have any problems during the whole time he/she is using it.
*   The administrator page will be organized in different sectors for each of the business processes including: attendance, finance, security, chat etc. It is thought that when the administrator will be logged in, all the sites where he has access will be displayed in the middle of the screen separated in squares, so not to create any confusion.

3 main types of users:
* Administrators (the group members)
* Facilities Manager (the owner and teachers)
* Parents
